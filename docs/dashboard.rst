   Dashboard Run Details Page

The Run Details page shows the progress and result of an experiment. You can track metrics like ``train loss`` and ``validation accuracy`` as well as see the ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` logs of all workers.

It also allows you to download all the metrics of a run as well as resource usage of all workers participating in the run as json files.
